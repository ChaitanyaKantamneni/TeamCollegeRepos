        <p>
            Libraries range widely in size, up to millions of items. Libraries often provide quiet spaces for private studying, common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration, and public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the Internet.
            Some patrons may not know how to fully utilize library resources, or feel unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have an impact on use.
            An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or not properly trained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness.
            In the public libraries of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the library instruction movement, which advocated library user education. One of the early leaders was John Cotton Dana.
            The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as information literacy.
